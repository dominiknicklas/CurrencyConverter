Welcome to my Currency Converter Application!

To get started, you'll need to create an account on the CurrencyAPI website: https://currencyapi.com. Once registered, you'll receive an API Key.

Next, navigate to the Access.java file located at src/main/java/com/dnicklas/currencyconverter and paste your API Key into the apiKey String field.

Your application is now ready to run!

Feel free to expand the list of supported currencies by adding them to the dropdownValues.properties file located under src/main/resources.
Simply look up the desired currencies on the CurrencyAPI website and append them to the file.
